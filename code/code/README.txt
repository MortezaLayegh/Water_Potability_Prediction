This platform is implemented in MATLAB 2022, and the whole description is provided in the poster and video attached.
In the following, you can see the instruction to run the code:



- To test the Random Forest model Run Test_RF.m
- To test the Naive Bayes model Run Test_NB.m
- To train a new  Random Forest model Run Train_RF.m
- To train a new  Naive Bayes model Run Train_NB.m#


When you open the zip folder you find the following files:
- Test1.csv
